            <p>Ram and Ajay were very close friends. They were studying in the same school and in the same class.</p>
            <p> Ram always stood first in the examinations, while Ajay would be second.</p>
            <p>Once Ram's mother fell sick. She became serious , so Ram missed his school classes for two months as he had to take care of his mother. But unfortunately , even after the all the care he had taken , his mother died.</p>
            <p>After a fortnight Ram started attending school. But he was lagging behind the class as he had missed a lot of portion. Hence everybody felt that in the exam Ajay would stand first instead of Ram.</p>
            <p>But when the results were declared, as usual Ram had secured the first rank , while Ajay stood second. The teacher was very much surprised. He re-examined Ajay's papers. Then he found that Ajay had left several of his answers incomplete.  From the answers the teacher understood that Ajay had deliberately left them incomplete inspite of knowing them.</p>
            <p>So , the teacher called Ajay and asked , "Ajay , why did you do this ?"

                Ajay replied , "Sir , my friend Ram is more intelligent than I. This time he was behind the class because of his mother sickness and death , which has made him heart broken. Then at such time , if I would have stood first Ram would have felt even more sad and disheartened. Therefore I fulfilled my duty as a friend."</p>
            <p>On hearing this , the teacher was very pleased with Ajay. He exclaimed with admiration , "Ajay , you will be a great person one day. Today you have passed a much greater examination ." </p>
